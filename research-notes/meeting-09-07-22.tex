Meeting with Olga at 2:00 pm. Next meeting with Olga and Russell at 10 am on Wednesday.

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The reference: \\
    \emph{An unbalanced Optimal Transport splitting scheme for general advection-reaction-diffusion problems}.
    \item The big picture of the problem on singular limits, there are two limit $\nu\to 0$ and $m\to \infty$ where there is a kernel
    \begin{equation*}
        K_\nu * v
    \end{equation*}
    The detail I cannot recall right now.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stuff to research about}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Hele-Shaw problem
    \item Related problem with Russel Schwab, original solution by Caferalli.
\end{itemize}
